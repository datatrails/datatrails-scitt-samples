# This workflow configures the repository specific choices of which CI builds
# must pass in order for a build to merge. This allows a sinlge global teraform
# configured rule to require a "well known" check in each repository. Whilst
# granting repository stakeholders the ability configure what workflows are
# appropriate to satisfy that check.
